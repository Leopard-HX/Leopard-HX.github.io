If Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, in particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational “constant” theory, where $$G_\text{eff}$$ depends on the horizon area.
